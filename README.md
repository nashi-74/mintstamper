Current features:  
-Emote parsing  
-Filtering profanities  
-HBD separation  
-Crowded tag highlights  
-Note and control stamp highlights  
-Copy to clipboard  
-Custom emote string handling with the possibility of setting the emote string via the url

TODO (I'll eventually get around to it):  
-A somewhat decent manual  
-Global stamp offsets  
-Comment separation based on the total character count
